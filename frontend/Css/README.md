# 🎨 The CSS Journey: From Zero to Layout Hero

Welcome to my CSS learning repository! This folder tracks my progression through the world of styling, starting from basic syntax to advanced responsive design and modern layout engines.

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Progress

I have organized my learning into specific milestones. Each sub-folder or file corresponds to a specific concept:

### 1. The Basics (Foundations)
* **Selectors & Combinators:** Mastering how to target elements (`#id`, `.class`, `nth-child`).
* **The Box Model:** Understanding `margin`, `border`, `padding`, and `content`.
* **Typography:** Google Fonts integration, line-heights, and letter-spacing.
* **Colors & Backgrounds:** Hex, RGBA, HSL, and linear gradients.

### 2. Layout Mastery
* **Floats & Positioning:** The "old-school" way (Absolute, Relative, Fixed, Sticky).
* **Flexbox:** One-dimensional layouts (Align-items, Justify-content).
* **CSS Grid:** Two-dimensional power (Grid-templates, areas, and gaps).

### 3. Responsive Design
* **Media Queries:** Creating "Mobile First" designs.
* **Relative Units:** Using `em`, `rem`, `vh`, `vw`, and `%` for fluid layouts.
* **Clamp & Calc:** Dynamic sizing without the math headaches.

### 4. Advanced Styling & Animation
* **Transitions & Transforms:** Smooth hover effects and 2D/3D rotations.
* **Keyframes:** Creating complex, multi-step CSS animations.
* **Variables (Custom Properties):** Theming and keeping code DRY.
* **Pseudo-elements:** Getting creative with `::before` and `::after`.
